# Data Exploration Using Pandas

## Overview
The purpose of this Jupyter notebook is to analyze and manipulate data sets with the Python libraries `pandas` and `plotly`. The tasks range from manipulating a simple fruit dataset to extracting insights from a baby names dataset take from online. This project also explores an election dataset to identify winning political parties.

## Features
- **Data Manipulation:** Utilizes Pandas for data cleaning, manipulation, and exploration.
- **Data Visualization:** Includes an example of plotting data with Plotly.
- **Data Import:** Demonstrates how to download and read data directly from the web.
- **Complex Queries:** Showcases filtering and sorting data to derive meaningful insights.

## Usage
Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment and run each cell sequentially to observe the results.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Python libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`

## Input
- A manually created fruit dataset within the notebook.
- A baby names dataset downloaded from `https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/names.zip`.
- An elections dataset expected to be in CSV format within the working directory.

## Output
The outputs are manipulated data tables and data visualizations which can be viewed directly within the Jupyter notebook's interface.

# Notes
- Ensure the file path of all the CSV files are correctly set up.
- Visual outputs are generated using plotly and might require internet access for interactive components.
